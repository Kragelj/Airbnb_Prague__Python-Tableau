# Airbnb Market Analysis – Prague
A data-driven approach to understanding the short-term rental market.

## Introduction
Prague, the heart of Central Europe, is one of the most sought-after travel destinations due to its rich history, breathtaking architecture, and vibrant culture. With the growing popularity of Airbnb, short-term rentals are reshaping the housing market, offering both opportunities and challenges for investors and hosts.

This study aims to analyze Airbnb listings in Prague to provide valuable insights into price trends, spatial distribution, accommodation types, and profitability. Additionally, we compare these findings with real estate selling prices to assess the viability of investment opportunities across Prague’s districts.

To visualize our data effectively, we used Tableau Public, offering dynamic mapping and intuitive graphical representations. Visualization is available on my [Tableau Public profle](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/m.kra/vizzes).

Tableau visualization helped us with displaying Airbnb listings geographically, showing concentration in various districts, analyzing district-wise rental patterns, identifying high-demand zones, and mapping Airbnb vs. real estate prices, revealing investment opportunities.
